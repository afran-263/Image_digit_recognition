# ðŸ”¢ Image Digit Recognition
A Deep Learning-Based Web App for Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview
Image Digit Recognition is a deep learning project that identifies handwritten digits (0â€“9) from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

This project showcases the use of computer vision and neural networks for pattern recognition tasks using the popular MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Draw digits on a web canvas and recognize them instantly

- Trained CNN model using PyTorch or TensorFlow

- Achieves high accuracy on MNIST handwritten digit dataset

## Tech Stack

- Model: CNN trained on MNIST dataset

- Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV, TensorFlow or PyTorch, Flask, Pillow
