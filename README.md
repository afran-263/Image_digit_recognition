# ðŸ”¢ Image Digit Recognition
A Deep Learning-Based Web App for Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview
Image Digit Recognition is a deep learning project that identifies handwritten digits (0â€“9) from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project includes a simple web interface where users can draw a digit, and the model will classify it in real-time.

This project showcases the use of computer vision and neural networks for pattern recognition tasks using the popular MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Draw digits on a web canvas and recognize them instantly

- Trained CNN model using PyTorch or TensorFlow

- Achieves high accuracy on MNIST handwritten digit dataset

- Flask-powered web interface

- Real-time prediction from user-drawn digits on browser canvas

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript

- Backend: Python, Flask

- Model: CNN trained on MNIST dataset

- Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV, TensorFlow or PyTorch, Flask, Pillow
